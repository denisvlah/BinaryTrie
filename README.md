# BinaryTrie

C# implementation of binary trie. 

All operations of the data-structure is implemented in a way that it produces minimal ammount of garbage.

It is also supports the IDictionary interface and retrivial of all items sorted by keys in O(n*log(n)).

The binary trie can be backed by array or mapped file.
The binary trie backed by mapped file is persistent to the disk.

Not all features are implemented. This is work in progress.
